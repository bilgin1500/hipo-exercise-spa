# Front-end exercise with [Hipolabs](https://hipolabs.com/)

This is an exercise application built with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/getting-started). To get started clone the repo and install the dependencies with npm:

```
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/bilgin1500/hipo-exercise-spa.git
cd hipo-exercise-spa
npm i
```

After installing the dependencies you can build the [development version](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-4-mode-and-optimization-5423a6bc597a) via `npm run build` command and production version via `npm run build:prod` command. Both versions will be built into the `dist` folder (after first deleting its contents).

To run the website on your localhost you can use `npm start`. The port is :8080. (Which can be changed in the webpack.config file)

_In order to build and run the code you should have [node](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) installed._
